<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This guidance provide set of questions to help analytical and statistical teams evaluate the quality of their analysis throughout the production cycle.</p>
<p>The aim of producing this guidance is:<br>
1. To ensure there is a consistent QA approach across divisions/departments.<br>
2. To help teams comply with best practice guidance by promoting the use of AQUA book and Code of Practice for Statistics.<br>
3. To ensure there is a consistent understanding of quality across the team.<br>
4. To encourage them producing important project documentation i.e., assumptions’ log, decision log, risk register etc.<br>
4. Sign post users towards relevant resources for evaluating quality.</p>
<section id="similar-guidance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="similar-guidance">Similar Guidance</h2>
<p>This guidance has heavily refernced text from AQUA book and Code of Practice for Statistics. Two other guduances have motivated us to produce this. One is analysis function guidance on ‘Quality questions and red flags’ and the other is OSR guidance on ‘Thinking about quality when producing statistics’.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-is-this-guidance-different" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-is-this-guidance-different">How is this guidance different?</h2>
<p>Building on the cross-government resources on best practice, this gudiance takes one step further by separating the quality questions relevant for each stage of analysis. The quality questions will only be fit for purpose if they are asked at the right stage, once that stage is passed, it will be difficult going back and addressing the risks.</p>
<p>Quality questions are also separated as per the responsible individuals required for answering them. The idea is to highlight a clear line of accountability as per AQUA book guidance in an easy-to-understand manner. The hope is to make it easier for the teams to clearly see the AQUA roles.</p>
<p>Each question is linked with the Code of Practice for Statistics (pillars and practices). This is to help the users understand the pillars and practices of Code of Practices covered by the quality question.</p>
</section>
<section id="when-to-use-this-guidance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-to-use-this-guidance">When to use this guidance?</h2>
<p>We encourgae all teams starting to work on a new piece of analysis to maintain the log of answers using this templates. For teams, who have already, they can still think backwards for the questions asked at the scope and design stage. Teams can also use it in undersatnding the AQUA roles and Code of Practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="structure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>There are 60 questions in total covering all stages of analytical cycle. AQUA book has divided the stages of analytical cycle into 1) Scoping, 2) Design, 3) Conducting and checking analysis and 4) Delivery<br>
We tried to be consitent in the use of terminology by sticking with these stages.</p>
<p>Each stage is divided into the following tabs:</p>
<section id="aqua-roles" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aqua-roles">AQUA roles</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that the responsibilities required to deliver analysis that is fit-for-purpose, AQUA book identifies a framework with 3 important roles: the commissioner, the analyst and the analytical assurer. Moreover, there has to be an SRO.</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Commissioner<br>
* Ensures that context is understood so QA is appropriate and proportionate<br>
* Ensures that there is enough time and resource for required assurance and account for risk<br>
* Must understand strengths and limitations including uncertainty so results are interpreted correctly<br>
* Delivers QUALITY OF OUTCOME</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Analyst<br>
* Assist the commissioner in framing the question to ensure the right analysis is done<br>
* Manage external specialists<br>
* Design, build, document and run the analysis<br>
* Delivers QUALITY OF CONTENT</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Analytical Assurer<br>
* Ensures that the evidence is there to demonstrate that appropriate QA has happened and uncertainty is communicated appropriately<br>
* Advises the commissioner on whether appropriate QA has happened and about any outstanding risks<br>
* Involved throughout from design through to use<br>
* Delivers QUALITY OF PROCESS</p>
<p>Responsibilities of SRO<br>
* A Single Responsible Owner for each model throughout its lifecycle</p>
<p>For the purpose of this guidance, it would be useful if all teams identify commissioner, analytical assurer, analyst and SRO. There main duties are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a link to AQUA book</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="code-of-practice-for-statistics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-of-practice-for-statistics">Code of Practice for Statistics</h3>
<p>There are three pillars of Code of Practice for Statistics i.e., Trustworthiness, Quality and Value. Each pillar has 4 to 8 principes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a link to Code of Practice for Statistics ### Log of Answers<br>
We encourage teams to answer all questions in the tab ‘Log of Answers’ and save a copy on your machine. Anyone having the HTML file will be able to edit answers and the answers can be copied from this HTML to be in other files. As you will be saving the log of answers on your machine, people who don’t have access to your HTML file will not ne able to see your answers. Answering 60 questins may seem a daunting task but this log of answers will later save your time on reading and fully undertsanding AQUA book and in ensuring your analysis/statistics complies with Code of Practice. It would also help you in writing the analysis/output report along the way. Moreover, most of the answers would help you in producing other important documents, for example, assumptions’ log, decision log, technical guide for users etc.</li>

Analysis must be well understood by relevant users, or else risks scope creep and misspecification. You should identify stakeholders and users who should be consulted before designing an analysis and take account of their views and considerations<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>wherever relevant. Consulting the right stakeholders makes sure that your team and your users have a shared understanding and vision of what is the best way to approach answering the question, what the output should look like, how well the users understand the process, its quality and limitations, and what can be done to tailor the final ouput to best meet user needs.

Being clear about the outputs required and the level of error that is acceptable is essential for ensuring that the final output is accurate and reliable and that users and your team have a good understanding of limitations and uncertainty. It is also essential when designing verification and validation activities that will help you to check the robustness of results under a range of plausible assumptions about methods and data.

<td class="xl6632690" width="396" style="width:297pt">
Without a clear understanding of time and resource constraints, you may overcommit. It is important to push back against unrealistic demands if the team is not able to set aside sufficent time to effectively quality assure the analysis. The users and commissioner should fully understand and accept the associated risks to quality when time and resource pressures are unavoidable and will mean that there are unavoidable risks to quality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>

It is important to understand potential legal, financial or reputational consequences if the work is not carried out correctly so that you can design a proportionate set of assurance activities.

Before starting an analysis, identify all the skills and resources needed to produce the final output in a sustainable and reproducible way and to quality assure it at every step.
