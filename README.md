# My_first_regression
This is my first repository and I have created it with the following aims: 
a) To practice creating a repository in Github and getting fluent in pushing and pulling changes. 
b) To understand the libraries needed to read and visualise data on Python and to practice running a linear regression.
c) To practice using Quarto in Visual Studio. 
c) The aim is to fully understand the functions used in Quarto_QA_Example to generate an automated report (link: https://github.com/joe9perry7/Quarto-QA-example)
