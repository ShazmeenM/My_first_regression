# Feedback 

We are keen to understand the challenges faced by analytical and statistical teams within ONS in complying with best practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of this guidance in understanding the Aqua roles and Code of Practice for Statistics, we have designed a short survey.  

Please click on the following link to access the survey: <https://forms.office.com/e/ya2ZzRbGHM>

Your feedback is highly appreciated and will help us in creating additional tools and resources on good practice for producing quality analysis.

If you have any further questions about this guidance or survey please email ASAP@ons.gov.uk with "modelling" in the subject header.
