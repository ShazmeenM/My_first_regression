    "text": "This guidance provides a set of questions to help analytical and statistical teams evaluate the quality of their analysis throughout the production cycle. We hope that this guidance would help in meeting the Office for National Statistics’s (ONS) strategic objectives for improving statistical quality.1\nThe aim of producing this guidance is:\n\nTo ensure there is a consistent end-to-end QA approach across divisions/departments.\n\nTo make it easier to comply with the good practice guidance i.e., The Aqua Book guidance and Code of Practice for Statistics.\n\nTo ensure there is a consistent understanding of roles and responsibilities towards producing high quality analysis and statistics.\n\nTo make it easier to produce important project documentation i.e., assumptions and decisions log , Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) and risk and issue register etc.\n\nThis guidance sits alongside a) Aqua book2 , which provides good practice advice on how to quality assure analysis in government and b) Code of Practice for Statistics, which sets the standards that producers of official statistics should commit to. Two other guidance have motivated us to produce this. One is Analysis Function guidance on Quality questions and red flags and the other is Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) guidance on Thinking about quality when producing statistics. Both of these guidance provide a set of questions that analysts producing statistics can use to interrogate their work and assure its quality.\nBuilding on these cross-government resources on good practice, this guidance separates quality questions relevant for each stage of analytical cycle. The quality questions will only be fit for purpose if they are asked at the right stage, once that stage is passed, it will be difficult going back and address the risks.\nEach question is linked with the Code of Practice for Statistics which is based on three pillars - trustworthiness, quality and value. The idea is to emphasize on the importance and relevance of each question in light of the three pillars. It would also help the analytical/statistical teams better understand and apply these principles through out the project life cycle.\nQuality questions are also separated as per the responsible individuals required for answering them. The idea is to highlight a clear line of accountability as per the Aqua book guidance in an easy-to-understand manner. The hope is to make it easier for the teams to clearly see the Aqua roles."

    "section": "Structure of the guidance",
    "text": "Structure of the guidance\nThere are 60 questions in total covering all stages of analytical cycle. Answering 60 questions may seem a daunting task but this log of answers would later help you in fully understanding the Aqua book and in ensuring your analysis/statistics complies with Code of Practice. It would also help you in writing the analysis/output report along the way. Moreover, most of the answers would help in producing other important documents, for example, assumptions’ log, decision log, technical guide for users, QIP etc.\nThe Aqua book has divided the stages of analytical cycle into:\n\nScoping\n\nDesign\n\nConducting and checking analysis\n\nDelivery\n\nEach stage is further sub-divided into the following tabs:\n\na) Quality Questions\nThis tab lists the quality questions relevant for each stage of analytical cycle and it provides space in the form of editable text boxes (with no word limit) to write the answers. We encourage commissioner, analyst and analytical assurer to answer all questions as per their responsibilities identified in the introduction.\nAs user needs or project aims may change over time, the template allows you to edit answers by simply changing the text in the editable text boxes. To track these changes, the person writing the answer should include their full-name, the date they have added the answer, and the date the next review is due on.\nSenior responsible owner (SRO) needs to sign-off all the answers. Its best to complete and save log of answers for each stage of analytical cycle. Answers can be saved by pressing Ctrl+S. To undo a action press Ctrl+Z. Pressing Ctrl+S will automatically download a copy of the page on your machine.\n\n\nb) Importance\nIt emphasizes on the importance of understanding each quality question and explains the potential risks and benefits around it.\n\n\nc) Code of Practice for Statistics\nIt shows the pillars and principles of Code of Practice for Statistics a quality questions relates to. The text in this column is copied from Code of Practice for Statistics. The Code is not concerned only with official statistics. It provides producers of non-official statistics with a framework they can voluntarily comply with.\n\n\nd) Aqua roles and responsibilities\nIt explains the responsibilities required to deliver analysis that is fit-for-purpose. It links the quality questions with relevant responsibilities at each stage of analytical cycle as identified in the Aqua book. The roles and responsibilities in this tab are copied as is from AQUA book.\nThe Aqua book recommends the creation of four identifiable roles to cover different areas of responsibility- SRO, commissioner, analyst and analytical assurer.\nResponsibilities of SRO\n- A Single Responsible Owner for each model throughout its lifecycle.\n- Sign-off all important decisions made about a model to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose, prior to its use.\nResponsibilities of Commissioner\n- Ensures that context is understood so QA is appropriate and proportionate.\n- Ensures that there is enough time and resource for required assurance and account for risk.\n- Must understand strengths and limitations including uncertainty so results are interpreted correctly.\n- Delivers QUALITY OF OUTCOME.\nResponsibilities of Analyst\n- Assist the commissioner in framing the question to ensure the right analysis is done.\n- Manage external specialists.\n- Design, build, document and run the analysis.\n- Delivers QUALITY OF CONTENT.\nResponsibilities of Analytical Assurer\n- Ensures that the evidence is there to demonstrate that appropriate QA has happened and uncertainty is communicated appropriately.\n- Advises the commissioner on whether appropriate QA has happened and about any outstanding risks.\n- Involved throughout from design through to use.\n- Delivers QUALITY OF PROCESS."

    "section": "Which outputs this guidance apply to?",
    "text": "Which outputs this guidance apply to?\nThe guidance applies to both ad-hoc releases and more regular outputs.\nRegular outputs often fulfil at least one of the criteria of “business critical model” (i. drives essential financial and funding decisions; ii. essential to the achievement of business plan actions and priorities; iii. must be error free or else risk serious financial, legal, reputational damages or penalties). They require the highest level of scrutiny and the governance arrangements must be appropriate for the level of risk.\nAd-hoc outputs with quick turnarounds and limited time and resources, the analysis still requires good quality assurance to avoid costly mistakes. Ad-hoc outputs are often used as an evidence to make important policy decisions.\nWe strongly encourage the responsible owners of both regular and ad-hoc outputs to answer all questions relevant to their role. Completing the log of answers will only require a few hours of their time and it will make the team more confident to raise quality and resourcing issues, push back against unreasonable demands and to understand and communicate the potential risks right at the scoping stage."

It enables your team to scope out requirements, understand the strengths and limitations of the analysis and ensure that it is fit for purpose. If the question is unclear you risk designing and delivering analysis which does not meet user needs.\n\n\n\n\nQ2\n\n\nWhy do we need to answer this question?\n\n\nExploring and understanding the need for, purpose of and end use of analysis will help you to understand the importance and impact of your work, how it supports decision making and how others will use it. It will also help you to make sure that all stages of analysis are fit for purpose and that the final output correctly answers the question you began with.  \n\n\n\n\nQ3\n\n\nWhich organisational priorities does this work address?\n\n\nSetting out how the work aligns with organisational priorities helps you to understand how the work fits with wider strategic objectives and how important it is to carry out the analysis now. It informs the level of assurance needed to make sure the work is fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\nQ4\n\n\nIs the model business critical?\n\n\nIdentifying if the model is business critical helps to define the level of assurance needed to ensure it is fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\nQ5\n\n\nWho needs to know the answer?\n\n\nIf you don’t know what your outputs will be used for, you cannot be sure that they will meet user needs. A good understanding of likely use cases and how you prioritise them is an essential part of making sure that all parts of your analysis are fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\nQ6\n\n\nWho do we need to consult to make sure we meet the right user needs?\n\n\nAnalysis must be well understood by relevant users, or else risks scope creep and misspecification. You should identify stakeholders and users who should be consulted before designing an analysis and take account of their views and considerations  wherever relevant. Consulting the right stakeholders makes sure that your team and your users have a shared understanding and vision of what is the best way to approach answering the question, what the output should look like, how well the users understand the process, its quality and limitations, and what can be done to tailor the final ouput to best meet user needs.\n\n\n\n\nQ7\n\n\nHow will you know you have answered this question correctly?\n\n\nBeing clear about the outputs required and the level of error that is acceptable is essential for ensuring that the final output is accurate and reliable and that users and your team have a good understanding of limitations and uncertainty. It is also essential when designing verification and validation activities that will help you to check the robustness of results under a range of plausible assumptions about methods and data.\n\n\n\n\nQ8\n\n\nWhat is the estimated time and resource required to answer this question (in months)?\n\n\nWithout a clear understanding of time and resource constraints, you may overcommit. It is important to push back against unrealistic demands if the team is not able to set aside sufficent time to effectively quality assure the analysis. The users and commissioner should fully understand and accept the associated risks to quality when time and resource pressures are unavoidable and will mean that there are unavoidable risks to quality. \n\n\n\n\nQ9\n\n\nWhat are the consequences if the work is not carried out now?\n\n\nUnderstanding why the work needs to happen now will help you to prioritise and make sure that limited resources are targeted to the right activities.\n\n\n\n\nQ10\n\n\nWhat are the consequences if the work is not carried out correctly?\n\n\nIt is important to understand potential legal, financial or reputational consequences if the work is not carried out correctly so that you can design a proportionate set of assurance activities. The nature and extent of the principal risks that the organisation is willing to take in achieving its objectives should also determined alongside informing decision making.\n\n\n\n\nQ11\n\n\nWho is the commissioner, SRO and analytical assurer of this analysis?\n\n\nClear lines of accountability strengthen assurance processes and make sure that important decisions are signed off by the right people. There should be a clear understanding of who is responsible for managing, producing and quality assuring the analysis in the team. \n\n\n\n\nQ12\n\n\nWhat tools and resources will you use during the production process? Are they the best for the job?\n\n\nBefore starting an analysis, identify all the skills and resources needed to produce the final output in a sustainable and reproducible way and to quality assure it at every step. The platform used to host the analysis and the software to build and run the analysis should be appropriate given uses and risks. For example, producing critical outputs in Excel does not comply with best practice and is unlikely to be robust or verifiable.\n\n\n\n\nQ13\n\n\nDo you have the right internal and external resources and capability to deliver the analysis?\n\n\nIf the team lacks capability, sufficient resource or time, this increases the risk that the analysis will not be fit for purpose or sufficiently assured. \n\n\n\n\nQ14\n\n\nWhat are the anticipated risks of the analysis? Have you discussed this risk with the customers? \n\n\nYou must identify potential risks and their impact well in advance to enable effective mitigation and quicker, confident decision-making. It is also important that users understand risks to ensure that their expectations and requirements are met. You should document how you have identified and are monitoring and mitigating risks.\n\n\n\n\nQ15\n\n\nHave you developed a contingency plan to put in place if the mitigation plan fails?\n\n\nRisks that would have a high impact on the analysis but a low probability of occurring should still be accounted for, or else risk serious harm to the public. Without well designed contingencies we put the public at risk.\n\n\n\n\nQ16\n\n\nDoes the data and model comply with ethical requirements? \n\n\nAnalysis must comply with ethics standards to ensure public confidence. Data ethics are an essential part of any good analysis. You should consider the ethical implications of the analysis and how they feed through to use of analysis when you create the workflow and report your findings.\n\n\n\n\nQ17\n\n\nWhat questions are outside the scope of the analysis?\n\n\nLimitations affect the workings of the analysis and the quality of outputs and what can be done with them. By being clear about the limitations of the analysis we ensure that we have mitigated or accepted them. Limitations must be documented so everybody using the analysis has a shared understanding of them.  \n\n\n\n\nQ18\n\n\nWill internal auditing and peer review be performed?\n\n\nInternal audit and peer review are critical for monitoring and assuring that the analysis is performed appropriately and its meeting the required aims and objectives. The outcomes of the peer review should be documented and any relevant actions and recommendations should be addressed and taken forward.\n\n\n\n\nQ19\n\n\nWill external experts be involved in development and scruitny of analysis?\n\n\nYour team should commission external specialists to peer review or audit the analysis in proportion to the risks around the analysis and its use. They should be.able to draw on expertise and experience across government and beyond to get feedback, exchange experience and best practices to improve the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Questions\n\n\nWhich pillar and principle of Code of Practice are relevant here?\n*Trustworthiness (T), Quality (Q), Value (V)\n\n\n\n\nQ1\n\n\nWhat question is the analysis trying to answer?\n\n\nV1.1 Statistics producers should maintain and refresh their understanding of the use and potential use of the statistics and data. They should consider the ways in which the statistics might be used and the nature of the decisions that are or could be informed by them.\n\n\n\n\nQ2\n\n\nWhy do we need to answer this question?\n\n\nV1.1 Statistics producers should maintain and refresh their understanding of the use and potential use of the statistics and data. They should consider the ways in which the statistics might be used and the nature of the decisions that are or could be informed by them.\n\n\n\n\nQ3\n\n\nWhich organisational priorities does this work address?\n\n\nT2.1 The Chief Statistician/Head of Profession for Statistics should have sole authority for deciding on methods, standards and procedures, and on the content and timing of the release of regular and ad hoc official statistics. This should include: determining the need for new official statistics, ceasing the release of official statistics, and the development of experimental statistics.\n\n\n\n\nQ4\n\n\nIs the model business critical?\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nQ5\n\n\nWho needs to know the answer?\n\n\nV1 Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported.\n\n\n\n\nQ6\n\n\nWho do we need to consult to make sure we meet the right user needs?\n\n\nV1  Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported. V1.2 Statistics producers should use appropriate ways to increase  awareness of the statistics and data, communicate effectively with the widest possible audience, and support users and potential  users in identifying relevant statistics to meet their needs.\n\n\n\n\nQ7\n\n\nHow will you know you have answered this question correctly?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely.\n\n\n\n\nQ8\n\n\nWhat is the estimated time and resource required to answer this question (in months)?\n\n\nT5 People producing statistics should be appropriately skilled, trained and supported in their roles and professional development. T4.3 Sufficient human, financial and technological resources should be provided to deliver statistical services that serve the public good. T3.5 Statistics and data should be released on a timely basis and at intervals that meet the needs of users as far as practicable. The statistics should be released as soon as they are considered ready, under the guidance of the Chie Statistician/Head of Profession for Statistics.\n\n\n\n\nQ9\n\n\nWhat are the consequences if the work is not carried out now?\n\n\nT2.1 The Chief Statistician/Head of Profession for Statistics should have sole authority for deciding on methods, standards and procedures, and on the content and timing of the release of regular and ad hoc official statistics. This should include: determining the need for new official statistics, ceasing the release of official statistics, and the development of experimental statistics.  \n\n\n\n\nQ10\n\n\nWhat are the consequences if the work is not carried out correctly?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely.\n\n\n\n\nQ11\n\n\nWho is the commissioner, SRO and analytical assurer of this analysis?\n\n\nT5.2 The roles and responsibilities of those involved in the production of statistics and data should be clearly defined with supporting guidance provided to help staff carry out their roles.\n\n\n\n\nQ12\n\n\nWhat tools and resources will you use during the production process? Are they the best for the job?\n\n\nT5 People producing statistics should be appropriately skilled, trained and supported in their roles and professional development. T5.5 Staff should be provided with the time and resources required to develop their skills, knowledge and competencies. T4.3 Sufficient human, financial and technological resources should be provided to deliver statistical services that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ13\n\n\nDo you have the right internal and external resources and capability to deliver the analysis?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely. T4.3 Sufficient human, financial and technological resources should be provided to deliver statistical services that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ14\n\n\nWhat are the anticipated risks of the analysis? Have you discussed this risk with the customers? \n\n\nV1  Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported. V4.3 Users should be involved in the ongoing development of statistics and data, exploring and testing statistical innovations, so that the statistics remain relevant and useful. Q3.2 Quality assurance arrangements should be proportionate to the nature of the quality issues and the importance of the statistics in serving the public good. Statistics producers should be transparent about the quality assurance approach taken throughout the preparation of the statistics. The risk and impact of quality issues on statistics and data should be minimised to an acceptable level for the intended uses. \n\n\n\n\nQ15\n\n\nHave you developed a contingency plan to put in place if the mitigation plan fails?\n\n\nT4.5 Organisations should be open about their commitment to quality and make clear their approach to quality management. They should ensure that the organisational structure and tools are in place to manage quality effectively, and promote and adopt appropriate quality standards.\n\n\n\n\nQ16\n\n\nDoes the data and model comply with ethical requirements? \n\n\nT6 Organisations should look after people’s information securely and manage data in ways that are consistent with relevant legislation and serve the public good. T1.1 Everyone that works in organisations producing official statistics should handle and use statistics and data with honesty and integrity, guided by established principles of appropriate behaviour in public life. \n\n\n\n\nQ17\n\n\nWhat questions are outside the scope of the analysis?\n\n\nQ1.6 The causes of limitations in data sources should be identified and addressed where possible. Statistics producers should be open  about the extent to which limitations can be overcome and the impact on the statistics. Q2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users. An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation.\n\n\n\n\nQ18\n\n\nWill internal auditing and peer review be performed?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely. T4.6 Independent measures, such as internal and external audit, peer review and National Statistics Quality Reviews, should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of statistical processes. Statistics producers should be open about identified areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\nQ19\n\n\nWill external experts be involved in development and scruitny of analysis?\n\n\nQ3 Assured quality Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely. T4.6 Independent measures, such as internal and external audit, peer review and National Statistics Quality Reviews, should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of statistical processes. Statistics producers should be open about identified areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Questions\n\n\nWho is responsible for answering this in light of AQUA book?\n\n\nWhich AQUA book responsibilities have a role?\n\n\n\n\nQ1\n\n\nWhat question is the analysis trying to answer?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nThe commissioner plays an essential role in communicating the commission and working with the analyst to ensure that an appropriate understanding of the problem is captured. \n\n\n\n\nQ2\n\n\nWhy do we need to answer this question?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe analyst must document the purpose of the analysis and the levels of quality and certainty that are required for this purpose. Commissioner and analytical assurer should make sure the work aligns with the stated purpose.\n\n\n\n\nQ3\n\n\nWhich organisational priorities does this work address?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nThe commissioner is responsible for ensuring that key aspects of the problem, scope and complexities, including programme constraints, are captured and clearly communicated and there is proportionate governance in place to support the analysis and its role in the wider project or programme \n\n\n\n\nQ4\n\n\nIs the model business critical?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nAll business critical models in government should be managed within a framework that ensures appropriately specialist staff are responsible for developing and using the models as well as quality assurance. In such situations, it is important that the decision-maker has sufficient assurance from a senior level within the organisation before taking the decision. For business critical analysis and modelling, the commissioner should be satisfied with the seniority of the analytical assurer.\n\n\n\n\nQ5\n\n\nWho needs to know the answer?\n\n\nCommissioner,analyst,  analytical assurer\n\n\nCommissioner should ensure appropriate stakeholders have been identified so that the scope and boundaries of the problem can be appropriately explored. Analyst and analytical assurer should also be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ6\n\n\nWho do we need to consult to make sure we meet the right user needs?\n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner\n\n\nAnalyst should explore the requirements, boundaries, and scope with all of the stakeholders ensuring a wide range of perspectives are sought. Commissioner should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ7\n\n\nHow will you know you have answered this question correctly?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nDuring the design and conduct of analysis phases, the commissioner may need to provide the analyst with important information on the level of precision and accuracy required. \n\n\n\n\nQ8\n\n\nWhat is the estimated time and resource required to answer this question (in months)?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nWhen commissioning a piece of analysis, a project is established and the typical project trade-offs between time, resources and quality must be made, recorded and communicated to the analyst. The analyst may also have a role in working with the commissioner to establish the optimal balance of these constraints.\n\n\n\n\nQ9\n\n\nWhat are the consequences if the work is not carried out now?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nThe commissioner has a role to ensure that there is sufficient time and resource for the required level of assurance to be delivered and that they understand the associated risks when time and resource pressures are unavoidable\n\n\n\n\nQ10\n\n\nWhat are the consequences if the work is not carried out correctly?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nThe commissioner must ensure that the analyst understands the context of the question being asked. This is so that the latter understands and can assess the likely risks and determine what the appropriate analytical and quality assurance response should be. \n\n\n\n\nQ11\n\n\nWho is the commissioner, SRO and analytical assurer of this analysis?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nDuring the engagement phase of the analytical cycle, the commissioner is responsible for ensuring that there is proportionate governance in place to support the analysis and its role in the wider project or programme.\n\n\n\n\nQ12\n\n\nWhat tools and resources will you use during the production process? Are they the best for the job?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nThe commissioner has a role to ensure that there is sufficient time and resource for the required level of assurance to be delivered and that they understand the associated risks when time and resource pressures are unavoidable.\n\n\n\n\nQ13\n\n\nDo you have the right internal and external resources and capability to deliver the analysis?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nThe commissioner has a role to ensure that there is sufficient time and resource for the required level of assurance to be delivered and that they understand the associated risks when time and resource pressures are unavoidable.\n\n\n\n\nQ14\n\n\nWhat are the anticipated risks of the analysis? Have you discussed this risk with the customers? \n\n\nAnalytical assurer, commissioner, analyst\n\n\nAnalystical assurer should challenge and test the understanding of the problem. Commissioner and analyst should be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ15\n\n\nHave you developed a contingency plan to put in place if the mitigation plan fails?\n\n\nCommissioner, Analytical assurer\n\n\nThe commissioner has a role to ensure that there is sufficient time and resource for the required level of assurance to be delivered and that they understand the associated risks when time and resource pressures are unavoidable. If there is a need for urgent action, such as a precaution against unacceptable but uncertain risks, the commissioner may request further analysis or evidence-gathering be commissioned in parallel to inform subsequent adjustments of the policy response when uncertainty is reduced. The analytical assurer is responsible for advising the commissioner on whether appropriate analytical quality assurance has taken place and advising them of any outstanding risks.\n\n\n\n\nQ16\n\n\nDoes the data and model comply with ethical requirements? \n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst should ensure that, if required, formal ethical approval is provided. Commissioner and analytical assurer should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ17\n\n\nWhat questions are outside the scope of the analysis?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nThere should be a clear understanding of the requirements and scope between the commissioner and the analyst at the commissioning stage. During the engagement phase of the analytical cycle, the commissioner is responsible for ensuring that key aspects of the problem, scope and complexities, including programme constraints, are captured and clearly communicated. \n\n\n\n\nQ18\n\n\nWill internal auditing and peer review be performed?\n\n\nAnalytical assurer, commissioner, analyst\n\n\nAnalytical assurer should ensure the level of quality checking of the analysis is appropriate for the decision being supported: All analysis requires some checks, at some level, by another competent person wherever and whenever practicable. Analyst and commissioner should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ19\n\n\nWill external experts be involved in development and scruitny of analysis?\n\n\nAnalytical assurer, commissioner, analyst\n\n\nAnalytical assurer should dry run the proposed approach to see if it delivers as intended. Then consider if the overall approach adequately addresses the complexities of the customer issue for this purpose. It is good practice to engage subject matter experts in this review. Analyst and commissioner should be involved."

It would help the team to evaluate if the current balance of the time split across these stages looks effective and challenge it if the target looks so ambitious. \n\n\n\n\nQ23\n\n\nDoes any part of the analysis rely on manual processing? Have you considered the cost and benefits of fully automating the process?\n\n\nManual processes are often inefficient and prone to user error - a manual process is inherently more risky than a well-designed automated one. Analysis with lots of manual steps (e.g. copying and pasting data from one file to another, updating cells in spreadsheets, or moving data between software packages with separate steps in each) is harder to assure and carries extra quality risks.\n\n\n\n\nQ24\n\n\nWhat happens if any of your team members, reviewers or users find a mistake in your analysis? Do you have a clear and efficient process for addressing the concern and preventing it from happening again?\n\n\nMistakes happen in analysis. There should be a clear and efficient process for reporting, documenting and addressing errors and mistakes that you find. Being open and honest about problems and working together to solve them in a supportive way creates an atmosphere of openness within your team and is critical for upholding users’ trust in your output. Your team should take reasonable steps to understand and document how and why errors came about and mitigate the risk of a similar error happening again. The mitigation approach should be consistent with your department’s revision policies.\n\n\n\n\nQ25\n\n\nHave you assessed uncertainty?\n\n\nUncertainty should be considered holistically throughout the analytical process. You should identify and review sources of uncertainty regularly, and bring it into your thinking as early as possible. Leaving the consideration of uncertainty until late in the process can be difficult and costly in time and resources. It may require you to revise the process or alter commissioning decisions accordingly. Moreover, if a potential source of uncertainty is overlooked at the begining, it could reduce the usefulness and impact of the analysis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWhich pillar and principle of Code of Practice are relevant here?\n*Trustworthiness (T), Quality (Q), Value (V)\n\n\n\n\nQ20\n\n\nIs there a simple description in plain English of what the analysis is for and what it does?\n\n\nV3 Statistics and data should be presented clearly, explained meaningfully and provide authoritative insights that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ21\n\n\nDoes the analysis have a logic flowchart which explains the end-to-end conceptual steps in the work flow?\n\n\nV3 Statistics and data should be presented clearly, explained meaningfully and provide authoritative insights that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ22\n\n\nWhen do you expect to start and finish each stage of analysis i.e., data collection, processing, quality assuarnce, analaysis and dissemination?\n\n\nT3.5 Statistics and data should be released on a timely basis and at intervals that meet the needs of users as far as practicable. The statistics should be released as soon as they are considered ready, under the guidance of the Chief Statistician/Head of Profession for Statistics. Q3.3 The quality of the statistics and data, including their accuracy and reliability, coherence and comparability, and timeliness  and punctuality, should be monitored and reported regularly. \n\n\n\n\nQ23\n\n\nDoes any part of the analysis rely on manual processing? Have you considered the cost and benefits of fully automating the process?\n\n\nV4 Statistics producers should be creative and motivated to improve statistics and data, recognising the potential to harness technological advances for the development of all parts of the production and dissemination process. T4.3 Sufficient human, financial and technological resources should be provided to deliver statistical services that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ24\n\n\nWhat happens if any of your team members, reviewers or users find a mistake in your analysis? Do you have a clear and efficient process for addressing the concern and preventing it from happening again?\n\n\nQ3.4 Scheduled revisions, or unscheduled corrections that result from errors, should be explained alongside the statistics, being clear on  the scale, nature, cause and impact. V5 Statistics and data should be published in forms that enable their reuse. Producers should use existing data wherever possible and only ask for more where justified.\n\n\n\n\nQ25\n\n\nHave you assessed uncertainty?\n\n\nQ2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users. An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWho is responsible for answering this in light of AQUA book?\n\n\nWhich AQUA book responsibilities have a role?\n\n\n\n\nQ20\n\n\nIs there a simple description in plain English of what the analysis is for and what it does?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst should produce appropriate design documentation. Best practice can include a concept of analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan. Analytical assurer should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ21\n\n\nDoes the analysis have a logic flowchart which explains the end-to-end conceptual steps in the work flow?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst should produce appropriate design documentation. Best practice can include a concept of analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan. Analytical assurer should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ22\n\n\nWhen do you expect to start and finish each stage of analysis i.e., data collection, processing, quality assuarnce, analaysis and dissemination?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nWhen commissioning a piece of analysis, a project is established and the typical project trade-offs between time, resources and quality must be made, recorded and communicated to the analyst. The analyst may also have a role in working with the commissioner to establish the optimal balance of these constraints.\n\n\n\n\nQ23\n\n\nDoes any part of the analysis rely on manual processing? Have you considered the cost and benefits of fully automating the process?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nThe analyst should use a risk-based approach to highlight the areas of greatest potential error and focus assurance efforts on these areas. It is important that the impact of any reduction in the thoroughness of analytical quality assurance activities is understood by the commissioner. \n\n\n\n\nQ24\n\n\nWhat happens if any of your team members, reviewers or users find a mistake in your analysis? Do you have a clear and efficient process for addressing the concern and preventing it from happening again?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe analyst should use a risk-based approach to highlight the areas of greatest potential error and focus assurance efforts on these areas.\n\n\n\n\nQ25\n\n\nHave you assessed uncertainty?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nCommissioners should request and expect information on uncertainty from analysts, and challenge them when it is absent, inadequate or ambiguous. In addition, commissioners of analysis may have identified sources of uncertainty as part of their wider considerations and should communicate these to the analyst. If it is possible for the commissioner to indicate in advance the consequences for decision-making of different degrees of uncertainty, this may enable the analyst to conduct their analysis at a proportionate level."

A clear understanding of how these processes affect the workflow is essential for understanding quality.\n\n\n\n\nQ27\n\n\nIs the data appropriate given the methods selected?\n\n\nA comprehensive understanding of data inputs is a prerequisite to meeting user needs.\n\n\n\n\nQ28\n\n\nWhat are the strengths and limitations of the data that you use? \n\n\nNot all data can be usd to answer particular research questions. The formatting, the time scale, the granularity must all be assessed and found relevant to the research question. A comprehensive understanding of data inputs is a prerequisite to meeting user needs. Without understanding where data is strong and where it is weak, it is impossible to make meaningful improvements to the analysis and/or the inputs to manage the limitations.    \n\n\n\n\nQ29\n\n\nIs there a robust relationship between your team and data providers? Does your data provider have a good understanding of how and why you are using their data? Do you have a good understanding of how the data provider collects, processes and quality assures the data?\n\n\nA good relationship with data suppliers helps to make sure that the data they supply meet your requirements. Lack of communication can mean you are not aware of quality risks or changes in collection or processing steps that may affect your results. You should be able to communicate with your suppliers as often as you need to to manage input quality. Data providers should also have a good understanding of how and why you are using their data. This can help them to improve data quality, value, and identify and address any gaps or issues that are relevant for your analysis.\n\n\n\n\nQ30\n\n\nIs there a formal agreement in place that specifies when, what and how the data will be received? If not, do you think this would be helpful?\n\n\nA formal agreement with data providers makes sure that everybody understands what will be delivered, when and how. It is useful for setting out clearly the division of responsibilities between data providers and your team for acessing and sharing the data, for example, formats, delivery, timescale, legal framework, accompanying metadata and quality checks. \n\n\n\n\nQ31\n\n\nDo you know what quality checks are carried out on the data before you receive them?\n\n\nData suppliers should be able to demonstrate that their data has been well assured and meets your needs. If there is no evidence of this it is cause for concern. Simply having a quality report is not enough. You should have sufficient evidence to understand that the data meet your needs and that reported quality matches what you observe in practice.\n\n\n\n\nQ32\n\n\nHow will you work with your data provider when your data requirements change?\n\n\nYou should review your data requirements regularly to ensure they are still relevant and feasible. Any change in requirements should be communicated to data providers well in advance and agreed upon by all stakeholders. If there is a formal agreement, it may need to be revised as requirements change. \n\n\n\n\nQ33\n\n\nHow do you know if your data provider makes a change to their systems or processes, which could impact the data you receive and/or the statistics you produce?\n\n\nOften the data suppliers make changes to their methodology or systems. This may not necessarily affect the quality of their data but it may impact on how you are processing this data and what findings can you infer from it. We consider it important to demonstrate that bilateral commuication between data supplier and your team is frequent, effective and ongoing so that you get timely information about any changes made by them. \n\n\n\n\nQ34\n\n\nHow did you choose the methods for the analysis? How do you know the method you are using is appropriate? \n\n\nYou should be able to explain why you chose the method by explaining the underlying assumptions of the method, its suitabilty for answering the research question and for the type and distribution of data you are using, and how was this decision signed off.\n\n\n\n\nQ35\n\n\nAre reasonable alternative methods have been explored and rejected for good reasons?\n\n\nThere is usually more than one way to answer a research question and meet the objectives of an analysis. By explaining why other methods/approaches were considered and rejected in favour of the method selected, your team and users can be confident that the chosen method is appropriate. Unless there is evidence underpinning your choice, users cannot be sure that you have alternate methods have been explored and rejected for good reasons.\n\n\n\n\nQ36\n\n\nHow do you know that your analysis or statistical process is working correctly?\n\n\nYou need to be sure that your analysis produces the outputs that you think it should and that the processes you run work as expected. If you cannot demonstrate that scripts and processes you have set up are functioning correctly, you cannot confirm the quality of the results.\n\n\n\n\nQ37\n\n\nCan you describe the assumptions of your analysis, when they were made and who made them and signed them off?\n\n\nA clear undersatnding of assumptions is important for understanding how the model/analysis simplifies the world and to mitigate the uncertainties present in every analysis. If assumptions are inadequately set out or absent, assumed characteristics about the analysis and its inputs will be opaque, greatly increasing risk. Without a comprehensive log of all assumptions made by the model, an audit trail back to sources signed off by assumption owners, a version control log reflecting when assumptions were last updated and evidence reflecting internal and external validation of assumptions, uncertainties may go unacknowledged and could drastically impact the outputs.  \n\n\n\n\nQ38\n\n\nHow the assumptions are validated and assured prior to use?\n\n\nA clear understanding of how assumptions have been externall and internally validated and signed off gives us confidence that they are reasonable.\n\n\n\n\nQ39\n\n\nHow do you measure and report uncertainty in your analysis?\n\n\nAll analysis contain some degree of uncertainty that may come from a variety of sources. Reporting uncertainties is important to inform users of how precisely we can give our reported values or how much confidence users can have in the analysis. It could also help your team to determine where an analysis can be improved. There are many ways to quantify uncertainty in input data, assumptions, processes and outputs. There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach. For instance, the size and distribution of the uncertainties in analytical inputs can be understood by comparing different data sources, understanding the probability distribution, break-even analysis, using expert judgement or historical data to inform ranges. Uncertainty in model outputs can be assessed with Monte Carlo techniques, convolution, scenario analysis,  previous forecasts, expert judgement, etc.\n\n\n\n\nQ40\n\n\nHave you considered the implications of any unquantified uncertainties?\n\n\nA good understanding of the uncertainties in the analysis workflow is critical to ensure the model and its outputs are fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\nQ41\n\n\nCan you explain the impact of your work/output on downstream processes? Are there any risks around these dependencies?\n\n\nUnderstanding how your analysis would be used by the primary and secondary users would help to ensure that the right quality and assurance levels are in place. It would help you to assess the risks around the use of analysis and if there are other stakeholders or users you need to consult.            \n\n\n\n\nQ42\n\n\nAll or part of the analysis is reliant on a single person?\n\n\nSingle points of failure carry significant business risk. If there is only one person who understands how to carry out all or part of the analysis then the process is extremely vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\nQ43\n\n\nIs it clear why important decisions were made and who made them?\n\n\nAll analysis involves decisions. A comprehensive record of the decisions made in specifying and conducting the analysis ensures that we have a full audit trail of why decisions were made, who made them and signed them off.\n\n\n\n\nQ44\n\n\nIf changes need to be made to any code or datasets, is it difficult to track who made these changes and why those changes were made? \n\n\nGood version control ensures that you have a full understanding of when, why and how changes were made to your analysis process. If it is hard to track changes, this makes it hard to retrace steps if there is a problem and means you do not fully understand the process\n\n\n\n\nQ45\n\n\nWould another analyst be able to reproduce your model output or continue the work (without talking to you first)?\n\n\nYour analysis must be well documented and repeatable so that somebody new can understand it, pick it up and produce the same output using the same inputs. Poor documentation means that other people will not understand why the process is configured as it is, how the process works, how to run the process safely and produce the same output- potentially leading to errors.\n\n\n\n\nQ46\n\n\nDo you use internal peer review to check scripts and code, documentation, implementation of methods, processes and outputs?\n\n\nThe team should independently review and validate the logical integrity of its analysis as well as the structure and functionality of the code against the research question the analysis asks. A record of validation and verification activities undertaken, outstanding activities and remedial actions is important to understand that the correct analysis has been performed for the purpose it is used for and the chosen approach minimises risk.\n\n\n\n\nQ47\n\n\nIs your code and analysis ever peer reviewed by someone outside your team or organisation?\n\n\nExternal peer review is one of the best ways to ensure that the analysis and code are well made and fit for purpose. Without it, teams may reinforce their own biases and will be unable to notice there is anything wrong.\n\n\n\n\nQ48\n\n\nWhat is the assessment of the quality of your analytical outputs?\n\n\nUnderstanding and reporting on the quality of your analytical outputs is critical to ensure fitness for purpose, as well as trust and reliability. This ensures that analysis can appropriately inform decision-making. Your quality assessments are also key information to be shared with your users as well as being a requirement of the Code of Practice for Statistics.\n\n\n\n\nQ49\n\n\nHow do you assure yourselves that analysis carried out is correct?\n\n\nIt is important to aasure the results fit with your expectations and you are able to explain why there are any discrepancies. It makes it easier to mitigate risk appropriately. There are various ways of assuring if the analysis is carried out correctly. For example, sensitivity analysis can help in understanding which inputs are having the greatest effect on the outputs, and which procesess within the model are the most critical.You can also compare figures from your analysis with any similar earlier analysis or test your data against historical series.\n\n\n\n\nQ50\n\n\nDo the outputs of your analysis match reported content?\n\n\nWhere possible, you should check that your outputs align with expectation from alternate data sources, previous methods and comparable studies. It would gives you confidence that the analysis is performing as expected. Your team should be able to explain any inconsistencies.\n\n\n\n\nQ51\n\n\nIf you find outliers or unusual trends in the data, what steps are taken to investigate them?\n\n\nIt is crucial to identify unusual trends in the data and understand why you had them there in the first place. Not all outliers are the same. Some have a strong influence, some not at all. Some are valid and important data values and some are simply errors. Outliers should be thoroughly investigated and reasonable steps should be taken to analyse their impact on your final output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWhich pillar and principle of Code of Practice are relevant here?\n*Trustworthiness (T), Quality (Q), Value (V)\n\n\n\n\nQ26\n\n\nHow the data used in the analysis will be processed prior to and during use?\n\n\nQ1 Statistics should be based on the most appropriate data to meet intended uses.

If not, do you think this would be helpful?\n\n\nQ1.3 A clear statement of data requirements should be shared with the organisations that provide that data, setting out decisions on timing, definitions and format of data supply, and explaining how and why the data will be used.\n\n\n\n\nQ31\n\n\nDo you know what quality checks are carried out on the data before you receive them?\n\n\nQ1 Statistics should be based on the most appropriate data to meet intended uses.

Reasons for any lack of consistency and related implications for use should be  clearly explained to users.\n\n\n\n\nQ34\n\n\nHow did you choose the methods for the analysis? How do you know the method you are using is appropriate? \n\n\nQ2 Producers of statistics and data should use the best available methods and recognised standards, and be open about their decisions.\n\n\n\n\nQ35\n\n\nAre reasonable alternative methods have been explored and rejected for good reasons?\n\n\nQ2 Producers of statistics and data should use the best available methods and recognised standards, and be open about their decisions.\n\n\n\n\nQ36\n\n\nHow do you know that your analysis or statistical process is working correctly?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely.\n\n\n\n\nQ37\n\n\nCan you describe the assumptions of your analysis, when they were made and who made them and signed them off?\n\n\nTransparency (cross cutting theme) is needed about processes, methodology and content. Transparency means being clear and open, for example, about the choices being made – and not holding back or being opaque about decisions. Within Quality, producers should explain what judgements they have made about the data and methods, and their strengths and limitations. These explanations are as important as the numbers themselves.\n\n\n\n\nQ38\n\n\nHow the assumptions are validated and assured prior to use?\n\n\nTransparency (cross-cutting theme) is needed about processes, methodology and content.

Do you have a good understanding of how the data provider collects, processes and quality assures the data?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe analytical assurer should expect to review evidence that there has been sufficient networking between analysts as the providers of data and other evidence sources. \n\n\n\n\nQ30\n\n\nIs there a formal agreement in place that specifies when, what and how the data will be received? If not, do you think this would be helpful?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nCommissioner may need to provide the analyst with agreement to the use of specific data. Analyst should ensure data formats, units, and context are properly understood and handled. Analytical assurer should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ31\n\n\nDo you know what quality checks are carried out on the data before you receive them?\n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\nAnalyst should understand data accuracy and uncertainties and capture, manage and understand implicit assumptions made. Analytical assurer should also be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ32\n\n\nHow will you work with your data provider when your data requirements change?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nDuring the design and conduct of analysis phases, the commissioner may need to provide the analyst with important information for the analysis to proceed or be asked for other essential input, i.e., agreement to the use of specific data and assumptions and provide agreement and sign-off to any assumptions that are developed as part of the project. Analyst should understand data accuracy and uncertainties and capture, manage and understand implicit assumptions made. Analytical assurer should also be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ33\n\n\nHow do you know if your data provider makes a change to their systems or processes, which could impact the data you receive and/or the statistics you produce?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nDuring the design and conduct of analysis phases, the commissioner may need to provide the analyst with important information for the analysis to proceed or be asked for other essential input, i.e., agreement to the use of specific data and assumptions and provide agreement and sign-off to any assumptions that are developed as part of the project. Analyst should understand data accuracy and uncertainties and capture, manage and understand implicit assumptions made. Analytical assurer should also be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ34\n\n\nHow did you choose the methods for the analysis? How do you know the method you are using is appropriate? \n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nDuring the design phase, the analyst will convert the commission into an analytical plan and will consider the inputs, possible analytical methods, and the expected outputs that will be produced. The analytical assurer should at this stage check that the proposed design meets the commissioner’s requirements.\n\n\n\n\nQ35\n\n\nAre reasonable alternative methods have been explored and rejected for good reasons?\n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\nAnalyst should review the structure of the analysis as a whole and consider carefully whether there are any other ways in which it could have been approached.\n\n\n\n\nQ36\n\n\nHow do you know that your analysis or statistical process is working correctly?\n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\nAnalyst should validate that the analysis requested is actually what the commissioner requires in order to answer the problem. \n\n\n\n\nQ37\n\n\nCan you describe the assumptions of your analysis, when they were made and who made them and signed them off?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst should capture, manage and understand implicit assumptions made. Analytical assurer should be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ38\n\n\nHow the assumptions are validated and assured prior to use?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nIf applicable, analyst should undertake parametric analysis to understand the consequences of missing or uncertain assumptions, Analytical assurer should be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ39\n\n\nHow do you measure and report uncertainty in your analysis?\n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner\n\n\nAnalyst should determine and communicate the uncertainty associated with the outputs of their analysis so that the commissioner can make informed decisions. The range of possible outcomes and their relative likelihoods should be described. \n\n\n\n\nQ40\n\n\nHave you considered the implications of any unquantified uncertainties?\n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner\n\n\nIf the uncertainties are too complex for analysts to quantify, even approximately, the analysts should say so in order that the commissioner can take this into account. \n\n\n\n\nQ41\n\n\nCan you explain the impact of your work/output on downstream processes? Are there any risks around these dependencies?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst should ensure implications of any data dependencies or relationships to other analysis or methods are understood. Analytical assurer should be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ42\n\n\nAll or part of the analysis is reliant on a single person?\n\n\nAnalytical assurer, analyst, commissioner\n\n\nAll analysis requires some checks, at some level, by another competent person wherever and whenever practicable. Comissioner, analyst and analytical assurer are all expected to be involved in each stage of analytical cycle. \n\n\n\n\nQ43\n\n\nIs it clear why important decisions were made and who made them?\n\n\nAnalytical assurer, analyst\n\n\nAnalytical assurer should ensure that a suitable audit trail is in place that clarifies the level of validation, scope, and risks associated with the analysis. Best practice includes the production of validation log books. Analyst should be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ44\n\n\nIf changes need to be made to any code or datasets, is it difficult to track who made these changes and why those changes were made? \n\n\nAnalytical assurer, analyst\n\n\nTo facilitate analytical audit, an appropriate version control systemshould be established for both the analysis as a whole and for the supporting data and assumptions. Analytical assurer should ensure a suitable audit trail is in place that clarifies the level of validation, scope, and risks associated with the analysis. Best practice includes the production of validation log books. Analyst should be involved. \n\n\n\n\nQ45\n\n\nWould another analyst be able to reproduce your model output or continue the work (without talking to you first)?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nQuality analysis needs to be repeatable. Analyst should check that the entire analytical process reflects the principles of RIGOUR (Repeatable, Independent, Grounded in reality, Objective, Uncertainty-managed, Robust)\n\n\n\n\nQ46\n\n\nDo you use internal peer review to check scripts and code, documentation, implementation of methods, processes and outputs?\n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\nIn addition to conducting the analysis, the analyst should also provide proportionate documentation that outlines the verification and validation activities that their analysis has been subjected to. When the analyst is conducting their analysis, they will be performing their own tests to check their analysis and they will commission other verification and validation activities as required.\n\n\n\n\nQ47\n\n\nIs your code and analysis ever peer reviewed by someone outside your team or organisation?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe people responsible for delivering the analysis frequently assist the commissioner in structuring the question in order to ensure the appropriate analysis is performed. Some analysis may require external specialists and therefore analysts may also have responsibilities as part of the procurement process. Analysts, including those 3rd parties providing analysis, should also provide proportionate documentation that outlines the verification and validation activities undertaken and the associated conclusion. The analytical assurer is responsible for advising the commissioner on whether appropriate analytical quality assurance has taken place. \n\n\n\n\nQ48\n\n\nWhat is the assessment of the quality of your analytical outputs?\n\n\nCommissioner, analytical assurer\n\n\nAs part of the delivery phase, the commissioner should ensure that there is an assessment of the level of analytical quality assurance of the analysis, making note of where there has been a trade-off between time, resources and quality. The analytical assurer is responsible for advising the commissioner on whether appropriate analytical quality assurance has taken place. \n\n\n\n\nQ49\n\n\nHow do you assure yourselves that analysis carried out is correct?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst testing covers those activities where the analyst builds in checks and processes to ensure that their analysis is correct. During the delivery phase, the commissioner has additional important roles, both in providing feedback to assist in the correct interpretation of the results and to determine whether the analysis has addressed their commission. When analyst are conducting their analysis, the analytical assurer can then comment on whether the analysis is still meeting the needs of the commission to ensure best use of the results\n\n\n\n\nQ50\n\n\nDo the outputs of your analysis match reported content?\n\n\nCommissioner, analyst\n\n\nWhen interpreting the results of a piece of analysis, the commissioner provides constructive challenge and, with the analyst, explores whether further analysis is required. \n\n\n\n\nQ51\n\n\nIf you find outliers or unusual trends in the data, what steps are taken to investigate them?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nIf applicable, analyst should undertake parametric analysis to understand the consequences of missing or uncertain data and assumptions. Analytical assurer should be involved."

The final output may represent predictions, involving lots of underlying assumptions. There is a risk that the primary or secondary users may misinterpret the findings, make wrong comparisons, use it for unsuitable purposes and arrive to wrong conclusions. For example, a non-expert user may wrongly interpret correlation as causation or use incomplete or disconnected data for forecast. It is, therefore, important to clearly inform and remind the users about the correct use of the output and what can and connot be inferred from it.\n\n\n\n\nQ53\n\n\nHave you assessed the impact of the data and model limitations and set out how they will affect the quality and use of the outputs?\n\n\nIt is important to describe why each limitation related to data and methods exist, why it cannot be overcome using the chosen approach and what impact does it have on the quality and interpretation of the output produced. Results are of very little value if limitations aren’t documented and the rationale for them explained.\n\n\n\n\nQ54\n\n\nHave you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?\n\n\nThe credibility of outputs should be checked by experts/relevant stakeholders/users and sense checked to ensure they are useful.\n\n\n\n\nQ55\n\n\nIs uncertainty related to data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?\n\n\nOutputs will never be 100% accurate. Users will need to understand how uncertainties related to data, assumptions and methodology feed into and through the analysis workflow and what this means for the use of the outputs. Results must clearly set out how uncertainty affects the findings from the analysis, or else we risk misinterpretations and conclusions being overly reliant on imprecise results.\n\n\n\n\nQ56\n\n\nAre the implications of unquantified uncertainties communicated to users?\n\n\nUsers should be provided with a sound understanding of important uncertainties which have not been captured in the analysis. Where possible, your team should make reasonable judgements about the likely size and direction of the unquantified uncertainty and provide a qualitative description informing users about why they can’t be quantified and what might be their likely impact.\n\n\n\n\nQ57\n\n\nIs model documentation including technical guide publicly available?\n\n\nTransparency about your analysis would enable proper scrutiny and challenge, promotes public trust and encourages re-use of the resources you develop.\n\n\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nDoes the technical guide explains how to use the model to obtain valid outputs?\n\n\nTechnical guide helps in understanding the analysis better and in getting familiar with it in less time. A well-written technical guide is esstential to maintain the analysis over the project cycle. It helps both the primary and secondary users of the analysis in replicating it, finding answers to their questions on methodology and in building their trust in the final output. \n\n\n\n\nQ59\n\n\nHave you fully documented the model code?\n\n\nTechnical guide can only serve its purpose if the model code is fully documented within it. Model code should be documented in a coherent manner for any new user of the model to understand and execute it as easily and quickly as possible. Code should follow best practice guidance.\n\n\n\n\nQ60\n\n\nAre users able to feed back on the suitability of outputs?\n\n\nThe more external critique exists within an analysis the better. Users in particular need to be able to feedback to your team to ensure that the results are meeting their needs. User feedback and customer reviews not only act to inform the team of the changes required but also act as evidence that users have been consulted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWhich pillar and principle of Code of Practice are relevant here?\n*Trustworthiness (T), Quality (Q), Value (V)\n\n\n\n\nQ52\n\n\nCould you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from your final output?\n\n\nQ2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users. An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation.\n\n\n\n\nQ53\n\n\nHave you assessed the impact of the data and model limitations and set out how they will affect the quality and use of the outputs?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely. Q1.5 Potential bias, uncertainty and possible distortive effects in the source data should be identified and the extent of any impact on the statistics should be clearly reported. Q3.1 Statistics should be produced to a level of quality that meets users’ needs. The strengths and limitations of the statistics and data should be considered in relation to different uses, and clearly explained alongside the statistics.\n\n\n\n\nQ54\n\n\nHave you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?\n\n\nQ3 Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent and timely.\n\n\n\n\nQ55\n\n\nIs uncertainty related to data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?\n\n\nQ1.5 Potential bias, uncertainty and possible distortive effects in the source data should be identified and the extent of any impact on the statistics should be clearly reported. Q2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users. An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation.\n\n\n\n\nQ56\n\n\nAre the implications of unquantified uncertainties communicated to users?\n\n\nQ2.4 Relevant limitations arising from the methods and their application, including bias and uncertainty, should be identified and explained to users. An indication of their likely scale and the steps taken to reduce their impact on the statistics should be included in the explanation. Q3.3 The extent and nature of any uncertainty in the estimates should be clearly explained.\n\n\n\n\nQ57\n\n\nIs model documentation including technical guide publicly available?\n\n\nV2 Statistics and data should be equally available to all, not given to some people before others. They should be published at a sufficient level of detail and remain publicly available.\n\n\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nDoes the technical guide explains how to use the model to obtain valid outputs?\n\n\nV2 Statistics and data should be equally available to all, not given to some people before others. They should be published at a sufficient level of detail and remain publicly available. V3 Statistics and data should be presented  clearly, explained meaningfully and provide authoritative insights that serve the public good.\n\n\n\n\nQ59\n\n\nHave you fully documented the model code?\n\n\nT4.4 Good business practices should be maintained in the use of resources. Where appropriate, statistics producers should take opportunities to share resources and collaborate to achieve common goals and produce coherent statistics. Q2.1 Methods and processes should be based on national or international good practice, scientific principles, or established professional consensus. \n\n\n\n\nQ60\n\n\nAre users able to feed back on the suitability of outputs?\n\n\nV1 Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported. V1.4 Statistics producers should engage publicly through a variety of means that are appropriate to the needs of different audiences and proportionate to the potential of the statistics to serve the public good. An open dialogue should be maintained using proactive formal and informal engagement to listen to the views of new and established contacts. Statistics producers should undertake public engagement collaboratively wherever possible, working in partnership with policy makers and other statistics producers to obtain the views of stakeholders. V1.5 The views received from users, potential users and other stakeholders should be addressed, where practicable. Statistics producers should consider whether to produce new statistics to meet identified information gaps. Feedback should be provided to them about how their needs can and cannot be met, being transparent about reasons for the decisions made and any constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nWho is responsible for answering this in light of AQUA book?\n\n\nWhich AQUA book responsibilities have a role?\n\n\n\n\nQ52\n\n\nCould you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from your final output?\n\n\nCommissioner\n\n\nDuring the delivery phase, the commissioner has another important role when they receive the interpretation of the results and determine whether it has addressed their request.\n\n\n\n\nQ53\n\n\nHave you assessed the impact of the data and model limitations and set out how they will affect the quality and use of the outputs?\n\n\nCommissioner, analytical assurer\n\n\nThe commissioner must be confident in the quality of the outputs and understand the strengths, limitations and contexts of the analysis so that the results are correctly interpreted. The analytical assurer sign-off provides confidence that analysis risks, limitations and major assumptions are understood by the users of the analysis \n\n\n\n\nQ54\n\n\nHave you sense checked outputs with user groups and stakeholders?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst and analytical assurere should assist peer review checks. Peer reviews may use internal or external parties to provide critical challenge of the analysis. The views of others – whether in an expert capacity or not – can provide constructive challenge to the analytical approach, application of a methodology or interpretation of the analysis. Verification checks may be performed by an analyst who has had no involvement in the  design and execution of the analysis in order to ensure that a fresh pair of eyes considers the analysis and the adopted approach\n\n\n\n\nQ55\n\n\nIs uncertainty related to data quality, assumptions and methodology clearly communicated to users?\n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\nThe analyst should determine and communicate the uncertainty associated with the outputs of their analysis so that the commissioner can make informed decisions. As part of the delivery phase, the commissioner should ensure that an assessment of uncertainty has been provided and that the implications of the uncertainties are understood \n\n\n\n\nQ56\n\n\nAre the implications of unquantified uncertainties communicated to users?\n\n\nAnalyst, commissioner\n\n\nIf the uncertainties are too complex for analysts to quantify, even approximately, the analysts should say so in order that the commissioner can take this into account. While communicating the results of analysis to decision-makers or other stakeholders, commissioner should be open about the existence of any deep uncertainties whose impact cannot be assessed, and explain how they are managing those uncertainties.\n\n\n\n\nQ57\n\n\nIs model documentation including technical guide publicly available?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nProduce appropriate design documentation. Best practice includes maintaining a record of the work that has been done in a technical report, including a concept of analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan.\n\n\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nDoes the technical guide explains how to use the model to obtain valid outputs?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nProduce appropriate design documentation. Best practice includes maintaining a record of the work that has been done in a technical report, including a concept of analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan.\n\n\n\n\nQ59\n\n\nHave you fully documented the model code?\n\n\nAnalyst, analytical assurer\n\n\nAnalyst should produce appropriate design and technical documentation. Best practice can include a concept of analysis, user requirements, design specification, functional specification, data dictionary, and test plan. all analysis should have documentation for the user, even if that is just the analyst leading the analysis. This is to ensure that they have captured sufficient material to assist them if the analysis is revisited in due course. Analytical assurer should be involved.\n\n\n\n\nQ60\n\n\nAre users able to feed back on the suitability of outputs?\n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\nThe utility of the analytical output can be assessed through gathering feedback from the end users about its practical benefits. Quality analysis should be free of prejudice or bias. In doing so, care should be taken to appropriately balance the views across all stakeholders and experts. Analyst should check that the entire analytical process reflects the principles of RIGOUR (Repeatable, Independent, Grounded in reality, Objective, Uncertainty-managed, Robust)"
